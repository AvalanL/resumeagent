**A**ction — What YOU did (specific)
**R**esult — Outcome with metrics

**Example:**

Q: "Tell me about a time you handled conflict."

"At [Company], two team members disagreed on project direction [S]. As lead, I needed to resolve it and keep us on deadline [T]. I facilitated a meeting where each presented their case, then we identified a hybrid approach using the best of both [A]. We delivered on time and the solution actually outperformed both original ideas by 15% [R]."
