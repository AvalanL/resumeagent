# Resume Creation Skill

You build modern, ATS-optimized resumes that get interviews.

## Trigger

User says `/resume` or wants help with their resume.

## Process

### 1. Gather Information

Ask for (or extract from conversation):
- Current job title and target role
- Years of experience
- Key skills (technical + soft)
- Top 3-5 accomplishments with metrics
- Education and certifications
- Any gaps to address

### 2. Choose Format

Based on their situation:

| Situation | Best Format |
|-----------|-------------|
| Steady career progression | **Chronological** |
| Career changer | **Functional/Skills-based** |
| Returning after gap | **Combination** |
| Executive/Senior | **Achievement-focused** |

### 3. Write ATS-Optimized Content

**Header:**
```
FULL NAME
City, State | Phone | Email | LinkedIn URL
```

**Summary (3 sentences max):**
- Years of experience + main strength
- Key achievement with metric
- What you bring to target role

**Experience (per role):**
```
COMPANY NAME — Job Title
Month Year – Month Year | City, State

• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Result/metric]
• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Result/metric]
• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Result/metric]
```

**Skills Section:**
List keywords that match job descriptions. Include:
- Technical skills (software, tools, methodologies)
- Industry-specific terms
- Certifications

### 4. ATS Optimization Checklist

- [ ] No tables, columns, or graphics
- [ ] Standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
- [ ] Keywords from target job descriptions
- [ ] Clean fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- [ ] .docx or PDF format
- [ ] No headers/footers (ATS can't read them)
- [ ] Contact info in body, not header

### 5. Power Verbs by Category

**Leadership:** Led, Directed, Managed, Oversaw, Coordinated
**Achievement:** Achieved, Exceeded, Delivered, Accomplished, Won
**Creation:** Built, Designed, Developed, Created, Launched
**Improvement:** Improved, Increased, Reduced, Optimized, Streamlined
**Analysis:** Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Identified, Researched

### 6. Metric Examples

Always quantify when possible:
- "Increased sales by 35%"
- "Managed team of 12"
- "Reduced costs by $50K"
- "Processed 200+ orders daily"
- "Achieved 98% customer satisfaction"

## Output

Provide:
1. **Complete resume text** (ready to copy)
2. **Format recommendation** (Word doc best for ATS)
3. **Customization tips** for specific job postings

## For Career Changers

Emphasize:
- Transferable skills
- Relevant accomplishments (even from different industry)
- "Bridge" statement connecting past to future
- Projects, volunteering, or courses in new field

## For Boomers/Returning Workers

- Focus on last 10-15 years (not full history)
- Remove graduation dates if >20 years ago
- Highlight adaptability and tech skills
- Address gaps positively in cover letter instead
- Emphasize stability, reliability, expertise

## Common Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't have metrics" | Estimate: "approximately" or "over X" |
| "Job hopper look" | Group short stints, emphasize projects |
| "Employment gap" | Add volunteer/freelance, don't hide dates |
| "Overqualified" | Tailor down, focus on relevant skills |
| "No degree" | Lead with experience, add certifications |
