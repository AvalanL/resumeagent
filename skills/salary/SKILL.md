# Salary Negotiation Skill

You help candidates get paid what they're worth.

## Trigger

User says `/salary` or needs negotiation help.

## Gather First

1. **What role and level?**
2. **What location?** (major salary impact)
3. **Current offer numbers?** (or expected range)
4. **Your current/most recent salary?** (optional)
5. **Other offers?** (leverage)

## Research Phase

### Sources for Salary Data
- **Levels.fyi** — Tech companies, verified data
- **Glassdoor** — Broad coverage
- **LinkedIn Salary** — Title + location specific
- **Payscale** — Good for ranges
- **H1B Salary Database** — Tech/foreign worker data
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics** — Industry averages

### What to Research
- Target role title
- Your location (or remote policy)
- Company size (startup vs enterprise)
- Your experience level
- Industry benchmarks

## The Negotiation Framework

### 1. Know Your Numbers

| Number | What It Is |
|--------|-----------|
| Walk-away | Minimum you'll accept |
| Target | What you actually want |
| Anchor | First number you say (aim high) |
| Market rate | Research shows this range |

**Your anchor should be at the top of market rate or slightly above.**

### 2. Don't Go First (If Possible)

When asked "What are your salary expectations?"

**Deflect:**
- "I'd like to learn more about the role before discussing numbers. What's the budgeted range?"
- "I'm flexible and focused on finding the right fit. What range did you have in mind?"
- "I'm looking at opportunities in the [broad range]. What were you thinking?"

**If they insist:**
Give a range. Your bottom number = your target.

### 3. When They Make an Offer

**Never accept immediately.** Even if you love it.

Say: "Thank you so much for this offer. I'm very excited about the role. I'd like to take some time to review the full package. When do you need my response?"

**Take at least 24-48 hours.**

### 4. The Counter

**Script:**

"Thank you again for this offer. I'm very excited about joining [Company] and the opportunity to [contribute X].

Based on my research and the value I'll bring — particularly my experience in [specific skill/accomplishment] — I was hoping we could get closer to [target number].

Is there flexibility on the base salary?"

**Key elements:**
- Gratitude + enthusiasm
- Justify with value, not need
- Specific counter number
- Open question

### 5. Beyond Base Salary

Negotiate the **total compensation:**

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Base salary | Start here |
| Signing bonus | One-time, often flexible |
| Annual bonus | Ask about guarantee |
| Equity/RSUs | Especially at startups |
| Start date | More time to transition |
| PTO days | Extra week? |
| Remote work | Days per week |
| Title | Affects future salary |
| Professional development | Conferences, courses |
| Relocation | If applicable |
| Review timing | 6-month review for raise? |

### 6. If They Say No

**Try:**
- "I understand the base is firm. Is there flexibility on [signing bonus / equity / PTO]?"
- "Could we agree on a 6-month review with a potential adjustment?"
- "Would a different title be possible that reflects the scope?"

**If truly no movement:**
- Get offer in writing
- Consider the full package
- Your walk-away number is your decision point

## Common Situations

### You're Underpaid Currently
Don't anchor to current salary. Focus on market rate.

"My current role has different scope. Based on market research for this position, I'm targeting [X]."

### They Ask Your Current Salary
Many places ban this question. You can:
- Give it (if helpful to you)
- Decline: "I'd prefer to focus on the value I'll bring to this role"
- Redirect: "I'm targeting [X] based on market research"

### Multiple Offers
**Leverage carefully:**
"I'm very interested in [Company], but I do have another offer at [X]. Is there any flexibility to help make this decision easier?"

**Don't lie about numbers.**

### First Job / Career Change
Limited leverage, but still negotiate:
- Research entry-level ranges
- Counter 5-10% higher
- Negotiate start date, PTO, title

## Email Templates

### Counter Offer Email
