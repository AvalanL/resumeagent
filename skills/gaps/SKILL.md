# Employment Gap Explainer Skill

## Strategies

### On the Resume

**Option 1: Address in Experience**
```
Career Break | Jan 2023 - Dec 2023
• Primary caregiver for family member
• Maintained skills through [courses/projects/volunteer work]
• Completed [certification] during this period
```

**Option 2: Functional Format**
Focus on skills, not timeline. Group by skill area rather than chronological.

**Option 3: Years Only**
Use years instead of months to minimize visible gaps.
```

```

### In Cover Letter

Address briefly, pivot to value:

```
"After taking time to [brief reason], I'm excited to return 
to [field] with fresh perspective and updated skills in [X]. 
During my time away, I [productive activity], which makes me 
even better prepared for this role."

4. Pivot to your value (rest of answer)

**Example:**

## Example

```
User: /gaps

Agent: Let's address your employment gap. Tell me:
       1. When was the gap? (dates)
       2. What was the reason?
       3. What did you do during that time?

User: Jan 2023 to now. I was taking care of my sick mom. 
      I did take some online courses.

Agent: That's a completely valid reason. Here's how we'll frame it:

       ✉️ IN COVER LETTER:
       "After a rewarding period as a family caregiver, I'm 
       excited to bring my refreshed skills and perspective 
       to [Company]. I used this time to complete my PM 
       certification and stay current with industry trends."
       
       🎤 IN INTERVIEWS:
       "I stepped away to care for a family member, which 
       was the right decision for me at the time. During that 
       period, I completed my Google PM certification and 
       maintained my skills through [courses/reading/projects]. 
       I'm now fully available and energized to contribute to 
       a team like yours."
