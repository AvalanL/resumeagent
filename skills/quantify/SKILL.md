# Achievement Quantifier Skill

Transform vague resume bullets into powerful, metrics-driven achievements.

## Trigger

User says `/quantify` or has weak bullets that need strengthening.

## The Problem

**Weak bullet:**
"Responsible for managing team and improving processes"

**Strong bullet:**
"Led team of 8 engineers to deliver product 3 weeks early, reducing costs by $50K"

## Process

### 1. Identify Weak Bullets

Look for:
- Starts with "Responsible for..."
- No numbers or metrics
- Describes duties, not achievements
- Vague words (helped, assisted, worked on)

### 2. Ask Probing Questions

For each weak bullet, ask:

**Scale Questions:**
- How many? (people, projects, customers, items)
- How much? (dollars, percentage, volume)
- How often? (daily, weekly, per quarter)

**Impact Questions:**
- What improved? (speed, cost, quality, satisfaction)
- By how much? (%, $, time saved)
- Compared to what? (before/after, vs. goal, vs. industry)

**Context Questions:**
- What was the challenge?
- What did you specifically do?
- What was the result?

### 3. Metric Types

| Category | Metrics to Look For |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Money** | Revenue, savings, budget, ROI |
| **Time** | Speed, efficiency, delivery |
| **Scale** | Users, customers, transactions |
| **Quality** | Satisfaction, accuracy, errors |
| **Growth** | % increase, new accounts, expansion |

### 4. Estimation Guidelines

If they don't know exact numbers:

**Use ranges:**
- "approximately" or "~"
- "over X" or "X+"
- Round numbers are fine

**Calculate from available data:**
- Team of 5 × avg salary = team budget
- 100 customers × $50/month = revenue managed
- 10 hrs/week saved × 52 weeks = 520 hrs/year

**Use comparisons:**
- "2x faster than previous method"
- "Top performer in team of 12"
- "First to achieve X in company history"

### 5. Transformation Formula

```
[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Quantified Result]
```

**Examples:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Managed social media | Grew Instagram following from 5K to 25K in 6 months (+400%) |
| Improved customer service | Reduced response time from 24hrs to 2hrs, improving CSAT by 35% |
| Led team meetings | Facilitated weekly syncs for 12-person team, reducing project delays by 40% |
| Handled customer complaints | Resolved 50+ customer issues monthly with 95% satisfaction rate |
| Worked on website | Redesigned checkout flow, increasing conversions by 28% ($150K annual revenue) |

### 6. Power Verbs by Impact

**For Leadership:**
Directed, Spearheaded, Orchestrated, Championed

**For Achievement:**
Exceeded, Surpassed, Outperformed, Achieved

**For Creation:**
Launched, Built, Developed, Pioneered

**For Improvement:**
Optimized, Streamlined, Transformed, Accelerated

**For Analysis:**
Identified, Discovered, Analyzed, Evaluated

## Quick Quantify Template

When stuck, use this formula:

```
[Verb] [what] for/to [who/scale], resulting in [metric] [improvement]
```

**Example:**
"Streamlined onboarding process for new hires, reducing training time by 40% (2 weeks → 1.2 weeks)"

## Output

For each bullet, provide:
1. **Original** (what they wrote)
2. **Questions** (what to find out)
3. **Rewritten** (with estimated metrics)
4. **Notes** (how to get exact numbers)

## Example Session

```
User: /quantify

Agent: Let's strengthen your bullets! Paste one that feels weak.

User: "Responsible for managing customer accounts"

Agent: Let's make this powerful. Quick questions:
       1. How many accounts did you manage?
       2. What was the total value?
       3. Did you grow them? Retain them?
       
User: About 50 accounts, maybe $2M total. I kept most of them.

Agent: What's "most" — 90%? 95%?

User: Probably like 92%

Agent: Perfect! Here's your new bullet:

       ❌ Before: "Responsible for managing customer accounts"
       
       ✅ After: "Managed portfolio of 50 accounts ($2M ARR), 
          achieving 92% retention rate and identifying 
          $200K in upsell opportunities"
       
       Even better if you know:
       - Industry average retention (to compare)
       - Actual upsells closed
       - Any accounts you grew significantly
```
