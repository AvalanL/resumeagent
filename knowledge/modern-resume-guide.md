- Exception: Senior executives, academics, federal
- Two pages only if 10+ years of relevant experience

### Skills Over History
- Gap employment less stigmatized post-2020
- Focus on what you can do, not just where you've been
- Skills-based hiring rising across industries

## The Winning Format

Skills
```

### For Career Changers: Combination
```
Contact Info

## ATS Survival Guide

### DO
- Use standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include keywords from job description
- Submit as .docx (Word) when possible
- Use simple formatting
- Include full company names

### DON'T
- Use tables or columns
- Insert graphics or images
- Use headers/footers (ATS can't read them)
- Get too creative with section names
- Use obscure fonts

## Sections Deep Dive

### Contact Info
```
FULL NAME
City, State | (555) 123-4567 | email@domain.com | linkedin.com/in/name
```

No need for:
- Full address (city/state sufficient)
- "Phone:" or "Email:" labels
- Personal details (age, photo, marital status)

### Professional Summary
**Formula:**
[Years] + [Expertise] + [Key Achievement] + [What You Offer]

**Example:**
"Marketing leader with 8+ years driving B2B growth strategies. Increased qualified leads by 145% at [Company] through integrated campaigns. Seeking to bring data-driven marketing leadership to a growing SaaS company."

### Experience Bullets
**Formula:**
[Power Verb] + [What You Did] + [Result/Impact]

**Weak:**
"Responsible for managing team"

**Strong:**
"Led team of 8 engineers to deliver product 3 weeks ahead of schedule, saving $50K in contractor costs"

### Education
**New grads:** More prominent, include GPA if >3.5, relevant coursework
**Experienced:** Below experience, degree + university + year (graduation year optional if >15 years)

### Skills Section
- 8-15 skills
- Mix of hard skills (software, tools, certifications) and soft skills
- Pull directly from target job descriptions
- Don't list basics everyone has (Microsoft Word, email)

## By Experience Level

### Entry Level (0-2 years)
- Lead with education
- Include internships, projects, volunteer work
- Emphasize potential and eagerness
- One page, no exceptions

### Mid-Career (3-10 years)
- Lead with experience
- Focus on progression and achievements
- Quantify everything possible
- One page preferred

### Senior (10+ years)

### Career Changers
- Strong summary explaining the pivot

- Consider combination format

### Employment Gaps
- Don't try to hide (gaps are obvious)

- Include any productive activities (freelance, learning, caregiving)
- Focus on what you learned/accomplished
