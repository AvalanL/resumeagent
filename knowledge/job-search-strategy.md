# Job Search Strategy Guide

## The Numbers Game (But Smarter)

### Quality Over Quantity
- 10 tailored applications > 100 generic ones
- Each application should take 20-30 minutes minimum
- Track everything in a spreadsheet

### Application Tracking
| Company | Role | Date Applied | Source | Status | Follow-up | Notes |
|---------|------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Example | PM   | 2/1          | LinkedIn | Interview | 2/8 | Went well |

## Where to Apply

3. **Join industry communities** — Slack groups, Discord, conferences
4. **Engage on LinkedIn** — Comment on posts, share insights
5. **Informational interviews** — Learn about companies, get referrals

## Application Strategy

### Before Applying
1. Research the company (news, products, culture, challenges)
2. Find keywords in job description
3. Identify mutual connections
4. Customize resume for this specific role
5. Write targeted cover letter

### After Applying
- Wait 5-7 business days
- Follow up via email or LinkedIn
- Connect with hiring manager or recruiter
- Keep applying elsewhere (don't wait on one)

### Follow-Up Email

## Timeline Expectations

| Stage | Typical Wait |
|-------|--------------|
| Application → Screen | 1-2 weeks |
| Screen → Interview | 1 week |
| Interview → Feedback | 1-2 weeks |
| Offer → Start | 2-4 weeks |

**Total realistic timeline: 6-12 weeks** (can be faster at startups)

## Staying Motivated

### Job Search is a Job
- Block dedicated time (2-4 hours/day when actively searching)
- Set weekly goals (X applications, Y networking calls)
- Track progress to see momentum

### Handle Rejection
- It's normal (average is 10-20 rejections per offer)
- Ask for feedback when possible
- Don't take it personally (timing, budget, internal candidate)
- Each "no" is closer to a "yes"

### Keep Skills Sharp
- Take courses during search
- Work on personal projects
- Volunteer for relevant experience
- Stay current in your field

## Red Flags in Job Postings

🚩 Vague responsibilities
🚩 "Fast-paced environment" (may mean understaffed)
🚩 "Wear many hats" (may mean doing 3 jobs)
🚩 Salary not listed (often means lowballing)
🚩 "Rockstar" / "Ninja" (unprofessional culture)
🚩 Posting up for months (can't fill = problem)
🚩 Reviews mention high turnover

## When You Get an Offer

1. **Express gratitude** — Enthusiastic but don't accept immediately
2. **Ask for time** — "I'd like to review the full package. When do you need a decision?"
3. **Review the offer** — Salary, bonus, equity, benefits, PTO, start date
4. **Negotiate** — See salary skill for details
5. **Get it in writing** — Before giving notice at current job
6. **Give proper notice** — Usually 2 weeks, be professional

## The Resignation

```
Subject: Notice of Resignation

Dear [Manager],

I'm writing to inform you that I've accepted a position at another company. 
My last day will be [date — typically 2 weeks from now].

I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had at [Company] and will do everything I can to ensure a smooth transition.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

Keep it professional. Don't burn bridges.
